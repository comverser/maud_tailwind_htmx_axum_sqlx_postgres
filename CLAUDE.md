# Rules

- Use a single standard and avoid exceptions or optional configurations to keep the codebase compact and maintainable
- Use `snake_case` for URLs (underscores)
- HTTP API handler names must follow the pattern: `method_endpoint`
  - endpoint: derived from the route pathâ€”static segments as-is; path params as {resource}_id; join with underscores

## Reminders

- Improve names for files, functions, variables, and other identifiers
- Minimize symbol visibility: make functions, types, and other items private unless they need to be public
